## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
**Termux Android**

Required dependencies `Python, FFmpeg, Pillow, yt-dlp, pydub`


**Before you put the commands below, use `termux-setup-storage` To allow storage to Termux**


## How to install and run the code

1- Install Python and FFmpeg first:
```bash
pkg install python ffmpeg
```
2 - Install the `pip` dependencies
```bash
pip install yt-dlp pillow pydub
```

3 - To run the file faster, you will create a .sh file directly from terminal

use:
```bash
pkg install nano
```

4 - After installing nano, you will create the .sh file on it, using:

```bash
nano 30fps.sh
```
put these commands there:

```bash
cd storage
cd shared
clear
python 30fps.py https://youtu.be/FtutLA63Cp8
```
or

```bash
cd storage
cd shared
clear
python 60fps.py https://youtu.be/W3MkjcHOGH8
```
Ctrl + O to save and Ctrl + X to exit nano

5 - To run the code, use `sh 30fps.sh` and wait until the code create everything, (there will be a log for you to watch)pip install yt-dlp pillow pydub
```
