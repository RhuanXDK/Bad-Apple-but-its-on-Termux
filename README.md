## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
**Termux Android**

Install dependencies:
**Before you put the commands below, use `termux-setup-storage` To allow storage to Termux**

```bash
pkg install python ffmpeg
pip install yt-dlp pillow pydub
```

## How to Install and run the code

To run the file faster, you will create a .sh file directly from terminal

use:
```bash
pkg install nano
```
After installing nano, you will create the .sh file on it, using:

```bash
nano "file_name_here".sh
```
put these commands there:

```bash
cd storage
cd shared
clear
python 30fps.py https://youtu.be/FtutLA63Cp8
```
or

```bash
cd storage
cd shared
clear
python 60fps.py https://youtu.be/W3MkjcHOGH8
```
Ctrl + O to save and Ctrl + X to exit nano

Then you will install Python, FFmpeg (using the `pkg install` command) and the necessary dependencies (commands shown in requirements). The code should work if you have installed correctly
